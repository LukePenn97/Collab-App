# CollabApp 

- An app for finding collaborators for online projects. Similar to dating apps that match based on preferences, it matches groups of people who are interested in working on the same kind of project. This app is tailored to people who want to work on side projects but don't have the networking skills to find collaborators.

Create your profile with your skills, and then search for a group based on those skills. You will be shown a selection of projects that match your settings. 

Once you join a project, you are connected to the in app chat room.

Target Audience:
People who have great ideas for a project, but need collaborators with specific skills
People who want to join a project, but donâ€™t have any ideas
Any professionals or amatuer project makers
Web designers, Software designers, youtubers, artists, writers, game designers
Mentors


## TODO: 

- refactor to remove unnesecary data stored on client side
- refactor to use react router
- Be able to block certain keywords
- project preferences and interests - group size, language, working hours
- other people could give you points for adding to the discussion and completing targets, like stack overflow.
- Once the group decided the project was complete, it would be displayed on the "completed projects" page of the app, and data about the group could be added to "successful groups" to help organize other groups in the future. If the group decided to abandon the project, the data could be added to "failed groups". 
- Analytics page, where you can see the success rate of your previous projects, timeline, points, etc.
- Media connections, linking fb, twitter, discord and zoom.
- Awards and badges to give to other people a la reddit
